# FoodIST

The goal of the FoodIST application is to improve the experience of using the IST
campi dining resources (cafeterias, bars, etc.). The app aims to provide real-time information
about where to eat at each campus, what is on the menu, and what is the
expected wait time in queue. Much of this information will be crowd-sourced, i.e. supplied
by the users themselves, including the menu items and their respective meta-data
(e.g. price) and photos.

## Getting Started

Download the .zip, open one command line to run the server and open the project in Android Studio.

### Prerequisites

To start, you will need [Java SE](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html), [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) and [Go Lang](https://golang.org) to run the local server.
After installing everything described above and correctly setting up all enviroment variables, you're good to go.

### Installing

After properly installing Go Lang, just run the following command inside the server folder:

```
go run server
```

Everything is now set up to run the app properly.
Enter Android Studio, emulate your app and enjoy!
